When from date and to date are chosen , an API is called and it fetches all the required data from the database with respect to the user-email that logged in. 
Once the details are fetched , the corresponding party names are displayed under the party name dropdown. The party name dropdown is a multi select dropdown.
Once the party name is selected , the cases under that party name are chosen and displayed with case status being all as default . 
The case status has four filters : All, Draft, In progress and Completed . Once the filter is set , the cases under that filter are displayed. The apply filter button needs to be clicked in order to set the filters
There is a case range entering where you can enter the from case ID and the to case ID

This filters and shows only the case details belonging to the cases between these IDs
The Lot ID filter allows you to filter the table by lot and when a particular lot is selected , it also displays a pie chart with the case stage vs number of cases criteria. When lot ID is None , all lot IDâ€™s details are displayed in the table but there will be no pie chart
